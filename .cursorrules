Read and follow the instructions in CLAUDE.md for comprehensive project context including:
- Clean Architecture layer boundaries and dependency rules
- Git command execution strategy and challenge system
- Room factory pattern and how to add new rooms
- Testing patterns (unit, integration, E2E)
- Save/load system architecture
- Conventional commit message format

Key rules:
- Domain layer has ZERO external dependencies
- Application layer imports only Domain
- Infrastructure implements interfaces from Domain/Application
- Use factory pattern for new rooms in src/GitOut.Infrastructure/Persistence/RoomFactories/
- All git commands execute via IGitCommandExecutor for testability
- Challenges get isolated temp directories via TempDirectoryManager
- Room instructions should ONLY use git commands, not shell commands like cat, type, ls, dir, etc.
  Use git show, git log, git diff, etc. to view file contents instead
